# Mario-Kart-Wii-Randomizer
Picks a random character and vehicle for you in Mario Kart Wii!

Requires Python 3 and above.

Note: Both .py files must be in the same directory for the program to work.

Run mario_kart_wii_randomizer as this is the main program. The other one is just the lists and randomizer that make the main file work.
